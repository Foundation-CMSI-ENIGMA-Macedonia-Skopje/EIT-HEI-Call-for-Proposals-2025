For Proposal B – ID Index™ (Digital Diagnostics), the consortium must lead in AI, Big Data, and Health Informatics. While Proposal A focuses on the "Therapeutic" application, Proposal B is the "Data Engine."
Following the same strategic logic (3 HEIs from 3 countries, balancing RIS/Non-RIS, and exclusive IP alignment), here are the recommended partners for the Diagnostic Track:
Selection Criteria for ID Index™ Partners
1.	KIC Affiliation: Primary focus on EIT Digital (AI/Data Science) and EIT Health (Health Data Space/Bioinformatics).
2.	Technical Competency: Excellence in Machine Learning, Biometric Data Analysis, and Cybersecurity (to handle "Digital Identity" data).
3.	Synergy: Ability to host "ID Index™ Labs" using the iMotions/g.tec exclusive hardware stack.

Strategic Recommendations for Proposal B (ID Index™)
1. The "AI Powerhouse" (Non-RIS / Northern/Western Europe)
•	Aalto University (Finland) – [EIT Digital Lead]
o	Why: Aalto is the "Gold Standard" for EIT Digital's Data Science track. They excel in human-centric AI and sensor data processing.
o	Role: Lead for WP2 (DeepTech STEM Training: AI Track). They will provide the high-level pedagogy for biometric algorithm development.
•	Politecnico di Milano (Italy) – [EIT Digital / EIT Manufacturing]
o	Why: One of Europe’s top technical universities with a massive department for Computer Science and AI.
o	Role: Lead for Scientific Validation of the AI Engine, ensuring the "Diagnostic Index" is robust and scalable.
2. The "Regional Innovation" Nodes (RIS Countries)
•	Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) (Hungary) – [EIT Digital Affiliated]
o	Why: Hungary is a strategic RIS partner with a world-class reputation in mathematics and computer science. ELTE is a hub for EIT Digital in Central/Eastern Europe.
o	Role: Deployment of the "Diagnostic Sandbox" where trainees work on real-world biometric datasets generated by the ID Index™ framework.
•	Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) (Estonia) – [EIT Digital / RIS]
o	Why: Estonia is the world leader in Digital Identity and secure data spaces. TalTech is perfectly positioned to handle the "Health ID" aspect of your proposal.
o	Role: Regulatory and technical lead for Digital Identity & Data Privacy (compliance with European Health Data Space).
3. The "Bioinformatics Node" (RIS / Southern Europe)
•	University of Porto (Portugal) – [EIT Health / RIS]
o	Why: Already a strong candidate for Proposal A, they are equally potent in Bioinformatics.
o	Role: Bridging the gap between the technical AI data and the clinical biomarkers required for Proposal B.

Strategic Advantage of this Configuration:
•	The "EIT Digital" Dominance: This consortium is heavily weighted toward EIT Digital, which is the correct KIC alignment for an AI-driven diagnostic engine like ID Index™.
•	Geographical Coverage: You cover the North (Finland/Estonia), the Center (Hungary), and the South/Balkans (Macedonia). This "Wide European footprint" is a specific scoring criterion in the 2025 Call.
•	Technical Moat: By pairing UKIM/ENIGMA with Aalto and ELTE, you are effectively creating a "Neural Network" of expertise that justifies the high TRL 7 status of your proposal.
