Based on a careful analysis of the EIT HEI KIC Affiliated HEIs List (2024/2025) and the strategic requirements for Proposal A – ENTRAINE®™ (Digital Therapeutics), I have selected a shortlist of HEI partners.
For ENTRAINE®™, the ideal consortium must bridge the gap between Neuroengineering (DeepTech) and Clinical Validation (Health). Since Ss. Cyril and Methodius University (UKIM) is the Lead/Anchor (RIS country), we need a mix of high-tier research universities and strategic RIS partners to maximize the score in the "Excellence" and "Impact" categories.
Selection Criteria for ENTRAINE®™ Partners
1.	KIC Affiliation: Primary focus on EIT Health (for Clinical/DTx) and EIT Digital (for BCI/HCI/Software).
2.	Strategic Competency: Excellence in Neuroscience, Medical Device Regulation (MDR), and Neuro-rehabilitation.
3.	Geographical Synergy: Balancing the North Macedonia (RIS) lead with strong Western European "Core" partners and additional RIS-country nodes.

Strategic Recommendations for Proposal A (ENTRAINE®™)
1. The "Scientific Powerhouse" (Non-RIS / Western Europe)
•	FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany) – [EIT Health Affiliated]
o	Why: One of the world’s leaders in Medical Engineering and Digital Health. They have a massive focus on medical startups and deep integration with the German MedTech cluster.
o	Role: Lead for WP2 (DeepTech STEM Training) and clinical methodology.
•	Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) – [EIT Health Affiliated]
o	Why: A global benchmark for neuroscience and medical research. Having KI in the consortium makes the "Excellence" section of the proposal virtually unassailable.
o	Role: External validation of the ENTRAINE®™ neuro-protocols.
•	KU Leuven (Belgium) – [EIT Health / EIT Digital Affiliated]
o	Why: Consistently ranked as Europe's most innovative university. They excel at transferring research to market (venture creation).
o	Role: Lead for WP3 (Venture Creation) and deep tech entrepreneurship modules.
2. The "Regional Innovation" Nodes (RIS Countries)
•	University of Ljubljana (Slovenia) – [EIT Digital / EIT Health Affiliated]
o	Why: Strong presence in the Balkans/Central Europe with excellent engineering and medical faculties. They act as a "cultural and geographical bridge" between UKIM and Western partners.
o	Role: Deployment of the Virtual Research Trial (VRT) in a RIS environment.
•	University of Porto (Portugal) – [EIT Health Affiliated]
o	Why: Portugal is a powerhouse in the EIT Health RIS ecosystem. U.Porto has specific expertise in digital therapeutics and patient-centric innovation.
o	Role: Large-scale student mobilization for the 4,000 trainee KPI.
3. The "Technical Integration" Node (Non-RIS)
•	Medical University of Graz (Austria) – [EIT Health Affiliated]
o	Why: Strategically located near the Foundation's logistical axis (MKD-AT-DE). They have world-class expertise in neurophysiology.
o	Role: Integration of the BeeMedic/g.tec hardware protocols into the university curriculum.

Recommended Consortium "Core" for the Portal
Role	Institution	Country	KIC Focus
Coordinator (Lead)	UKIM (Ss. Cyril and Methodius)	MKD (RIS)	STEM Leadership
Partner HEI 1	FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg	DE (Non-RIS)	EIT Health
Partner HEI 2	University of Ljubljana	SI (RIS)	EIT Digital
Partner HEI 3	University of Porto	PT (RIS)	EIT Health
Business Partner	Foundation CMSI ENIGMA	MKD (RIS)	IP & Tech Engine
Strategic Note from the Compliance Master:
This configuration fulfills the "3 HEIs from 3 different countries" rule and ensures that at least 2 HEIs are from RIS countries (UKIM and Porto/Ljubljana), which is highly favored in the 2025 Call. Furthermore, the inclusion of FAU or KU Leuven brings a "Brand Prestige" that helps justify the €2 Million budget request.
