As the DeepTech Scientific Officer, I have synthesized the Foundation's intellectual property and technical specifications to draft the Excellence section for the EIT HEI Call 2025. This draft focuses on the integration of Deep Tech (AI, Health, Biotech) to advance STEM capacity building.

****1. Excellence: Innovation and Deep Tech Ambition****

**1.1. TRL 7 Virtual Research Trial: ENTRAINE®™**

The primary innovation project, ENTRAINE®™, is a Software as Medical Device (SaMD) platform designed for Digital Therapeutics (DTx). It utilizes Audio-Visual BrainWave Entrainment (AVE) protocols to guide brain activity into desired states for neurorehabilitation and mental health management.

•	Scientific Feasibility: The trial implements Neural Entrainment Matrices powered by AI to synchronize brainwave frequencies (measured in Hz) with external stimuli.
•	Virtual Research Trial (VRT) Infrastructure: To ensure scalability and accessibility, the trial is decentralized, utilizing cloud-based data collection, wearables for continuous monitoring, and eConsent protocols.
•	Targeted Outcomes: The trial focuses on high-impact areas including Alzheimer's (ICD 10: G30.9), ADHD, and cognitive performance enhancement for youth.

**1.2. ID Index™: Diagnostic Biomarkers for Personalized STEM Education**

ID Index™ serves as the diagnostic foundation for the framework, providing the psycho-bio-metric biomarkers necessary for personalized learning and intervention.

•	Bio-metric Integration: The system integrates high-fidelity data from g.tec BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) systems and iMotions biometric sensors (EEG, HRV, GSR, and Facial Expression Analysis).
•	STEM Applicability: By quantifying cognitive and executive functions—such as focus, memory, and impulse control—ID Index™ allows for the creation of a Personalized STEM Education model that adapts to the physiological and psychological readiness of the student.

**1.3. Scientific Feasibility and Technical Specifications**

The project’s feasibility is defended through strategic partnerships with industry leaders:

•	iMotions Expert Certification: Ensures the highest standards in biosensor data integration and analysis.
•	g.tec BCI Technology: Provides medical-grade EEG and BCI systems for precise neural recording and feedback.
•	IntelliProve: Delivers contactless mental health checks, facilitating seamless integration into the virtual trial workflow.

****2. Exploitation Potential and IP Valuation****

The Foundation has established a robust Intellectual Property (IP) framework to ensure the long-term sustainability and commercial viability of the project.

•	IP Valuation: The ENTRAINE®™ IP is valued at an indicative €1.6 Million. This valuation accounts for the core IP, integration architecture, and the strategic option value of existing partnerships with iMotions, g.tec, and IntelliProve.
•	Commercial Strategy: The project utilizes a "dongle-bundle" model, where Foundation-owned IP is packaged with certified partner hardware and software solutions.
•	Regulatory Readiness: The IP Audit confirms a risk-isolated structure where the Foundation holds the IP while medical services are delivered via certified partners, ensuring compliance with EU MDR and SaMD regulations.

****3. Alignment with Deep Tech Talent Initiative (DTTI)****

The proposal directly addresses DTTI priorities by merging AI (automated protocol personalization), Health (DTx for dementia and mental health), and Biotech (neural interfacing and biometric monitoring). This multi-disciplinary approach ensures that the project not only builds capacity within Higher Education Institutions but also produces market-ready Deep Tech solutions with significant societal impact.
