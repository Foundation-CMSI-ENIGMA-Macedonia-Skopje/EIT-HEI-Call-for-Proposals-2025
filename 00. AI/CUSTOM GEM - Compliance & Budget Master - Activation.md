As the Compliance & Budget Master for Foundation CMSI ENIGMA Macedonia – Skopje, I have synthesized the regulatory requirements from the EIT HEI Call for Proposals 2025  and the Foundation’s strategic framework.

To ensure Proposal A (ID Index™) and Proposal B (ENTRAINE®™) are "Audit-Proof," the following financial and compliance mandates are established:


**1. Budget & Funding Structure (€2M Framework)**

Total Project Duration: 24 months (September 1, 2026 – August 31, 2028).

*Funding Rate: The initiative generally allows for a 100% funding rate of eligible costs, though the final maximum grant and parameters are fixed in the Project Grant Agreement (PGA) with the allocated KIC.

Resource Allocation: The consortium must consist of at least five partners:


  - 3 HEIs (at least two must be "novices").

  - 1 Business Partner (private enterprise).

  - 1 Other Non-HEI Partner.

Eligible Costs: Expenditures must align with Horizon Europe rules, specifically focusing on personnel, subcontracting, and other direct costs necessary for implementing the Innovation Vision Action Plan (IVAP).


**2. EUIPO Trademark Compliance (Classes 35, 41, 42, 44)**

Budget items will be strictly mapped to these classes to ensure eligibility under EU MDR guidelines where applicable:

  - Class 35: Business management and administrative support for diagnostic/therapeutic operations.

  - Class 41: Training and education activities (essential for STEM capacity building).

  - Class 42: Scientific and technological services, research, and design relating to ID Index™ and ENTRAINE®™.

  - Class 44: Medical and veterinary services; hygiene and beauty care (relevant to digital therapeutics/diagnostics).


**3. Risk Management & Liability Isolation**

  - Liability Isolation: Per the Foundation’s Brand Usage & Compliance Guide, the Risk Management Table must isolate liabilities between the Foundation (IP owner) and the 5 consortium partners.

  - Audit Readiness: The allocated KIC, EIT, European Commission, and OLAF retain the right to conduct audits and investigations for 5 years after project completion.

  - IP Protection: The Foundation retains full and exclusive ownership of its prior IP (| ICF Advanced™ | ID Index™ | ENTRAINE®™ |). Partners only receive rights necessary for project implementation as defined in the PGA.


**4. Statutory Financial Reporting**

  - Mandate Reflection: Financial reporting must reflect the Foundation Statute, ensuring that EIT funding is utilized solely for the non-profit, innovation-driven objectives of the Foundation.

  - KPI Tracking: Reporting is performed on a calendar-year basis. The consortium is collectively responsible for meeting mandatory KPIs, such as supporting at least one start-up (EITHE03.1).


**5. Compliance Checklist for Part A & Budget Template**

  - PIC Registration: All 5 partners must have a valid Participant Identification Code (PIC).

  - Dual-Topic Prevention: Ensure no double-funding or duplication between Topic 1 (STEM Capacity Building) and Topic 2 (Synergies), as this results in automatic exclusion.

  - Consortium Lead: The lead partner must be an HEI.

*I will now proceed to synchronize these financial parameters with the Strategic Lead and DeepTech Scientific Officer to finalize the Part A forms.
