Subject: 	Innovation Vision Action Plan (IVAP) Architecture – Proposals A & B

In alignment with the EIT HEI Call for Proposals 2025 and the established UKIM-ENIGMA MoU, I have architected the following strategic framework for our dual-proposal synchronization. This architecture ensures that Foundation CMSI ENIGMA serves as the definitive Ecosystem Focal Point, driving institutional transformation across the consortium.

**1. Consortium Composition (5-Partner Model)**

To satisfy the eligibility criteria for Topic 1 (STEM Capacity Building), we will deploy a consortium of five distinct entities across at least three Horizon Europe eligible countries:

•	Lead Partner (HEI 1): Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje (UKIM). As the leader of the Regional TECHSIGHT Deep Tech Innovation District, UKIM fulfills the requirement for a lead HEI and bridges the regional dimension.
•	HEI Partner 2 (Novice): A technical university from a different Member State (e.g., focused on AI/Biotech) to meet the "novice partner" and "Member State" requirements.
•	HEI Partner 3 (Novice): A research-intensive university from a third eligible country to complete the cross-border trio.
•	Business Partner: An industry leader in Digital Therapeutics or Diagnostics to integrate the ENTRAINE®™ business logic.
•	NGO/Non-HEI Partner: Foundation CMSI ENIGMA Macedonia – Skopje. Functioning as the "Ecosystem Focal Point," the Foundation provides the ICF Advanced™ framework and coordinates the Knowledge Triangle Integration (KTI).

**2. Governance Structure: The 'Ecosystem Focal Point'**

The Governance model is designed to ensure the Foundation maintains strategic control over its IP and methodology while driving consortium-wide impact:

•	Executive Steering Board (ESB): Chaired by the Lead HEI Project Coordinator, with the Foundation's Strategic Lead serving as the Technical & Innovation Director. This board oversees the IVAP milestones.
•	Ecosystem Focal Point (The Foundation): The Foundation acts as the central node for Knowledge Triangle Integration (KTI). It manages the flow between Education (ICF Advanced™), Research (ID Index™), and Business (ENTRAINE®™).
•	Faculty-Level Engagement: Each HEI partner must engage at least two faculties (e.g., Medicine and Computer Science) to ensure the deep-tech nature of the STEM capacity building is embedded at the institutional core.

**3. Knowledge Triangle Integration (KTI) Alignment**

The synchronization of our proprietary assets is mapped directly to the EIT pillars:

•	Education (ICF Advanced™): Deployed as the master training framework across all HEI partners. It will be the vehicle for reaching the 4,000 trainees target (students, academic, and non-academic staff) by August 2028, contributing to the EU STEM Education Strategic Plan.
•	Research (ID Index™): Focused on Digital Diagnostics (Proposal A), this asset will drive the "research-to-market" pipeline and the creation of STEM-based innovation outputs.
•	Business (ENTRAINE®™): Driving Digital Therapeutics (Proposal B), this asset facilitates the transition of academic research into market-ready solutions and potential start-up creation.

**4. Strategic Targets & KPIs (The 4,000 Trainee Mandate)**

To hit the 4,000 trainees target by 31 August 2028, the IVAP will implement:

•	Scale-up of Training: Integration of ICF Advanced™ into the official curricula of the participating HEI faculties.
•	KPI EITHE08.1: Systematic monitoring of participants (students and staff) completing innovation and entrepreneurship training.
•	Interdisciplinary Focus: Training will not be limited to STEM students but will include Technology Transfer Office (TTO) staff to ensure long-term institutional sustainability.

The IVAP is not merely a proposal; it is a tenacious roadmap for European deep-tech leadership. Our focus remains on the "Innovation and Entrepreneurship Pioneer" role, leveraging the Foundation’s prior ecosystem experience to guide novice partners toward high-impact results.

Status: Ready for final synchronization with the DeepTech Scientific Officer and the Compliance & Budget Master.
